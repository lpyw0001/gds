			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<blockquote>"…the supply of qualified engineers has continued to grow rapidly, resulting in increased
				unemployment. More importantly, opportunities for people with engineering qualifications to work in
				engineering have slowed dramatically, resulting in large numbers accepting jobs in endeavours beyond
				engineering. Many will not come back to the profession." (Institute of Engineers Australia, 2019).
			</blockquote>
			<p> Engineering is often regarded as a highly challenging, highly rewarding career path. I am currently in
				my fifth and penultimate year of a double degree in engineering and commerce and am excited but
				apprehensive about the transition to full time work in the labour market. After several years of
				full-time study, the intent of this graduate development strategy is to critically reflect on my current
				skill base, using Tomlinson’s (2017) graduate capital model as a framework for the analysis. From this
				analysis, reflect on what I have learned, and, what additional skillsets will be required to achieve my
				personal and professional development goals, factoring in inevitable setbacks. My overarching career
				goal is to pursue a job where I am challenged, I continue to learn, and I have the capacity to make a
				tangible difference. Whilst this may appear as an overtly broad goal, the corresponding details, and the
				strategies to strive for this goal, along with the learnings to-date are detailed in the three parts
				below.</p>
				
			<header class="major">
				<h2>Part 1:
					Where I am and where I want to be</h2>
			</header>

			<p>Five years ago, when I commenced my studies as an engineer, performing a search on Seek for “Mechatronics Engineer” jobs returned little to no results within Australia, with more available around Europe. Performing the same search in 2021, returns several pages of results, indicating the field has grown strongly within Australia, and given the increasing automation trend, the market need for mechatronics engineers appears strong and I am thus well positioned to capitalise on this trend. I am motivated by the problem solving, troubleshooting nature of engineering work, and the self-gratification when an appropriate working solution is reached. My vision is formed around my firm personal values, I want to pursue a full-time role as a mechatronics engineer, where I can make a tangible difference to those around me and lead a challenging but rewarding career. This would ideally be in the biomedical sector, working with cutting-edge technology, or the renewable energy sector, where there is an increasing demand for specialist skills. To work towards this vision, I have clear short (less than 12 months), and long-term (1-5 years) goals. The short-term goals are focused on developing my human and social capital whilst I complete my tertiary degree and include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Degree qualified as a robotics and mechatronics engineer</li>
					
					<ul>
						<ul>
						<li>PCB Design</li>
						<li>Solidworks CAD</li>
						<li>Python programming</li>
					</ul>
					</ul>
				
					<li>To continue to refine the ideal characteristics of the job I want to pursue</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Long-term goals are focused on my professional development and professional advancement and include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Continuing to learn not remain stagnant, develop my technical skills, keeping up with industry trends</li>
				<li>Have a professionally respected and trusted voice</li>
				<li>op leadership skills</li>
				<li>e for balance, this includes both work-life balance, and a balance between work-related stress but been challenged and enjoying what I do</li>
				<li>work for a large multinational company (for example Aurecon)</li>
				<li>continue to develop my soft skills, with a focus on communication, conflict resolution and teamwork</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The multidisciplinary skillset provided by mechatronics engineering is very appealing to me and provides for a wide range of job prospects. However, the counter side to this breadth is if I elect to pursue more of an electrically oriented roles the skills are not as well developed as individuals who specialised in electrical engineering. Hence, having clearly articulated goals, and recognising areas for self-improvement is paramount. 
				Tomlinson’s (2017) capitals are highly interrelated, and at present there are aspects within each capital that I excel at, and aspects that have significant room for growth. Thus, rather than focusing on just social capital in its entirely for instance, there are specific elements of this, such as the capability to recognise and capitalise opportunities that I should focus on. Areas within each capital that are strong, and areas for improvement are detailed below.
				</p>
		

				<strong>Human</strong>
				<p>Having completed a double degree specialising in finance and robotics and mechatronics, I have developed, and continue to develop a wide range of technical skills, by maintaining a good work ethic. As per advice from a secondary school maths teacher, my focus is on the understanding of the content rather than rote/memorisation-based learning approaches. This approach ensures I am in good stead for the transition to the labour market. I have developed further discipline specific knowledge, and a strong problem-solving mindset through over a thousand hours of experience in various internships, in both the industrial automation and HVAC sector. I am a slow learning, and can take a while to join the dots, however once the understanding is developed, I am able to conceptualise the topic in a broader view than what was just introduced. This additional time taken makes time management and self-discipline paramount and is an area for improvement to ensure the short-term goals, such as completing the SolidWorks, PCB and programming tutorials are completed by their respective deadlines. </p>

				<strong>Social</strong>
				<p>As discussed above I have started to develop a network of contacts, and ergo improved social capital, through several internships. In addition, I have developed strong customer side skills by working in a retail environment for several years, progressing up to a team leader role. I have cultivated this experience through further formal leadership training with Monash’s internationally recognised engineering leadership program, and through volunteer work managing several projects as a section lead with Monash Connected Autonomous Vehicle. This has strongly developed my teamwork and communication skillsets, which will be advantageous in any career direction. To further this development of my social capital, I will be proactive and attend several industry nights run by Monash and at least one workshop on developing an effective LinkedIn profile, as I have seen first-hand several colleagues get recruited through the platform. The main area for improvement is the ability to recognise opportunities as they arise, and leveraging ‘weak-ties’, this will be important both when job-hunting and when completing my final year project for engineering. </p>

				<strong>Cultural</strong>
				<p>I have developed a diverse range of friends and colleagues and have demonstrated a rich awareness in a variety of volunteer roles, both locally, for example on the local tennis club committee, and internationally. This exposure has fostered both my appreciation and understanding of various cultures to be able to present myself in a dynamic manner. Going forward, to continue to grow I should maintain an open mindset and be eager to both further my understanding and be adaptable.</p>

				<strong>Psychological</strong>
				<p>I have developed several possible career trajectories, some in the medical sector, some in the energy sector, these contingency plans help ensure I can continue moving forward and progressing my career. I have demonstrated a capability to perform under pressure and maintain high attention to detail working at one of the largest events in the southern hemisphere. I have demonstrated a capability to think on my feet and be adaptable through volunteer work with Robogals. In addition, between the internships I have completed I have encountered several setbacks, I have been made redundant, and learnt from mistakes along the way. From these, in addition to adapting to working and studying remotely, I have developed a stronger sense of self, learnt to be more proactive, make the most of my social environment, to have clear goals and expectations, and, critically, to be more resilient. As per a professional engineering survey, 77.8% of respondents reported a stressful work environment (Flaig, 2020). Thus, continuing to develop resilience, and the capability to be adaptable, and manage stress, will be critical to a long, healthy career as an engineer. </p>

				<strong>Identity</strong>
				<p>Through a firm set of values, being kind and adopting a consistent mindset, and setting clear goals I have continued to develop the skillsets that form my identity capital. By taking ownership and being deliberately introspective, I have developed a more accurate reflection of my strengths and the areas for improvement. Going forward to continue to address these areas for improvement I will continue to invest sufficient time in myself and developing action plans, maintaining a logical, rational mindset. </p>

			<h2>Part 2:
				What I’ve learned</h2>
			</header>
				<p>As per a survey of over 1500 CEOs, the most critical factor governing a business’s future success is creativity. Creativity can be defined as “the tendency to generate, or recognise ideas, alternatives, or possibilities that may be useful in solving problems, communicating with others…” (California State University Northridge, n.d.). Creativity is foundational is to businesses, and commerce as a subset of this, because it provides a point of <strong>differentiation</strong>. The importance of creativity has been highlighted by businesses needing to adapt to survive the economic hardship brought on by sustained lockdowns. </p>

				<p>Creativity fosters innovation and ensures companies remain competitive and do not stay stagnant. Moreover, creativity helps foster teamwork and enhances productivity by challenging conventional notions and encouraging the development of thought-provoking, unique ideas. The benefit is receiving a diverse range of ideas and proposed solutions as individuals and teams make connections between different ideas and solve new problems. This also enhances company culture for those who enjoy working in an environment that is conducive to creativity. The immediate benefit is an improved retention rate. Individually, creativity helps develop resilience, that is psychological capital, which is highly valued in an unpredictable and changing commercial environment. </p>

				<p>As part of BEX3500 I have demonstrated creativity in the form of video production, from scripting to graphic design to recording. In addition, the creation of two modern websites. Further to this, a creative mindset was demonstrated when coming up with novel ways Mastercard can help mitigate climate change given certain time and other constraints. This mindset will be advantageous to me as a commerce graduate as I can utilise this skillset advantageously for companies, by token of differentiation. Several important attributes directly associated with creativity are detailed below.</p>

				<p>Curiosity, always asking “why?” is key to engineering:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>develop an active mind, rather than a passive one</li>
					<li>general eagerness and excitement</li>
					<li>observant of new ideas and premises</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Calculated risk-taking: innovation cannot occur without some element of risk, such as the time and financial capital to pursue the R&D of a new idea:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Bring about unforeseen opportunities</li>
					<li>Convey confidence and not wonder what could have been</li>
					<li>Continue to learn and move forward, not stagnant due to a fear of change</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Flexible/Adaptable:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Enhanced value as an employee, people turn to you to motivate them to accommodate change</li>
					<li>Reduced stress, more resilient</li>
					<li>Enhanced productivity, more resourceful with a consistent determination</li>
					<li>Better equipped to be an effective leader</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Creative thinking is a highly demanded skill, “… [82% believed that] companies that are more creative gain greater business benefits like revenue growth and market share” (Forrester, 2014). Creativity requires an open mind and grit to see ideas through to completion, and thus further develops psychological capital. Utilising the creativity examples demonstrated in BEX3500 will be invaluable in providing a point of differentiation in a highly saturated job market, where the technical skills are the bare minimum. </p>

				<br>


			<p>Critical thinking is “the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skilfully conceptualizing, applying, analysing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action” (Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2019). Within the commercial realm, critical thinking is important considering increasing pressure for companies and individuals to be rational, resourceful and act in an ethical, sustainable, and responsible manner. </p>

			<p>Given an increasing speed of business, greater information flow, and increasing globalisation the ability to analyse, synthesize and evaluate information to make timely and rational rather than reactive decisions is key. This reduces the likelihood and severity of mistakes, saving money. Critical thinking provides a “significant and measurable competitive advantage” (Chartrand, Ishikawa & Flander, 2013, p. 8). It is important for organisational planning, and risk management/assessment to be able to pre-empt potential issues before they arise and consider a variety of perspectives to come to a measured conclusion. </p>

			<p>Effective critical thinking requires the use of several key attributes. It requires a diligent, open-minded approach and the capability to detect inconsistencies in reasoning. Individuals with strong critical thinking skills can help reconcile tension, as they are able to remain impartial by having an awareness of their own biases and predispositions. Critical thinking facilitates the capability to act with autonomy in changing environments and demonstrate clearer communications skills. This will be an invaluable skill as a commerce graduate. </p>
			<p>BEX3500 has required the utilisation of critical thinking skills on several occasions. Firstly, when coming up with rational, feasible solutions for the major project, demonstrating the ability to consider the merits of each proposed action plan, and ascertain potential consequences. In addition, critical thinking was demonstrated when planning the reflective interview questions to ensure the best use of the interviewees time. It was further demonstrated when reflecting on our individual strengths and weaknesses in relation to Tomlinson’s (2017) model. Finally, the workshop exercises, such as analysing the impact to stakeholders, considering the big picture and potential steps going forward required critical thinking.</p>

			<p>Critical thinking is important to be able to navigate complex ethical issues, or uncertainty, such as in risky or complex situations, which is pertinent in the field of mechatronics, and increasing automation and usage of artificial intelligence. Reflecting on the interview in relation to critical thinking, it is apparent even in large multinational companies, a lack of appropriate resources can be an issue, and thus critical thinking is required to generate appropriate solutions. An additional observation was that communication skills are essential, and these skills are strengthened by critical thinking and the capability to identify they key elements of a problem. Going forward I will maintain a deliberately curios and inquisitive nature to foster the growth of my critical thinking skills, as per Calma and Davis (2020) “Critical thinking is a leading skill for workplace, educational and life success.”</p>

					<p>In relation to the resources required to achieve the above objectives, most require a laptop, an internet connection, and a diligent, disciplined mindset. Additional costly hardware, such as oscilloscopes, that may be required to achieve goals 3 and 6 should be accessible once appropriate vaccination targets are reached and Monash Makerspace re-opens. </p>

					<p>Some potential setbacks include the steep learning curve associated with goals 2,3 and 5,6. To remedy these I will adopt a step-by-step approach, starting with smaller simpler projects, and gradually progress in complexity. Finding appropriate projects may also be difficult. Goal 1 will face time management constraints which can be addressed through organisation and planning. Whilst I am fortunate enough to have a graduate role already lined up if desired, I will continue to monitor Seek, LinkedIn etc. for potential graduate jobs to tailor the short- and long-term goals to, to keep doors open. </p>


					<h4>Long Term</h4>

						</table>
					</div>

					<p>The resources, potential impedances, and strategies to mitigate these to aid the successful accomplish of these objectives includes:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Contacts in a wide variety of companies to obtain a clear picture of the trends within industry. To address this, I will attend networking nights and utilise my growing social capital to develop and foster relationships</li>
						<li>An environment to develop and demonstrate the technical and soft skills to cultivate a professionally respected opinion. The challenge is finding an organisational culture that I gel with. To remedy I will conduct adequate research of the company, and reach out to employees where practical to gauge if an appropriate fit</li>
						<li>Leadership skills, ensure to take up any opportunities to develop and demonstrate. The challenge will be some engineering leadership roles within companies may involve a migration to a sales or project management role, which is not of interest at present </li>
						<li>Critical thinking and perception to recognise when there are no further opportunities in a stagnant position</li>
						<li>Cost will be an issue if pursuing a master’s degree. To remedy this, seek employment at a larger corporation where the master’s degree may be subsidized</li>
					</ul>

					<p>To achieve these long-term goals, I will focus on my identity capital, to gain a more accurate reflection of myself and my strengths and weaknesses. This will help me recognise how I can more effectively serve the team. Teamwork also requires strong communication skills, which in turn requires a strong technical foundation and critical thinking. It requires a demonstration of accountability, based on relationships formed from utilising social and cultural capital skillsets. Developing my psychological capital will also be crucial to appropriately managing stress in changing environments or meeting tight deadlines whilst maintaining sufficient attention to detail. </p>
