			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<blockquote>"…the supply of qualified engineers has continued to grow rapidly, resulting in increased
				unemployment. More importantly, opportunities for people with engineering qualifications to work in
				engineering have slowed dramatically...." (Institute of Engineers Australia, 2019).
			</blockquote>
			<p> Engineering is as a difficult but gratifying career path. I am currently in my fifth and
				penultimate year of a double degree in engineering/commerce and am excited but apprehensive about the
				transition to full-time work in the labour market. After several years of full-time study, the intent of
				this GDS is to critically reflect on my current skill base, using Tomlinson’s
				(2017) graduate capital model as a framework for analysis. From this, reflect on what I have
				learned, and, what additional skillsets will be required to achieve my personal and professional
				development goals, factoring in inevitable setbacks. </p>

				<h2>Part 1:
					Where I am and where I want to be</h2>
			</header>

			<p>Five years ago, performing a search on <a href="https://seek.com.au">Seek</a> for “Mechatronics Engineer”
				jobs returned little to no
				results within Australia. Performing the <a
					href="https://www.seek.com.au/mechatronics-jobs-in-engineering/in-All-Melbourne-VIC">same search</a>
				in 2021, returns several pages of results,
				indicating with increasing automation the field has grown strongly and I am thus well positioned to
				capitalise on this trend. I am motivated by the problem-solving, troubleshooting nature of engineering
				work, and the self-gratification when an appropriate working solution is reached. My vision is formed
				around my firm personal values, I want to pursue a full-time role as a mechatronics engineer, where I
				can make a tangible difference to those around me and lead a challenging but rewarding career. This
				would ideally be in the biomedical sector, working with cutting-edge technology, or the renewable energy
				sector, where there is an increasing demand for specialist skills. To work towards this vision, I have
				clear short (less than 12 months), and long-term (1-5 years) goals. The short-term goals are focused on
				developing my human and social capital whilst I complete my tertiary degree and include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Degree qualified as a robotics/mechatronics engineer</li>
				<li>Improve my technical skills in:</li>

				<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
					<li>PCB Design</li>
					<li>SolidWorks CAD</li>
					<li>Python programming</li>

				</ul>

				<li style="margin-top: -35px;">Refine the ideal characteristics of the job I want to pursue</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Long-term goals are focused on my professional development and advancement and include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Continuing to learn and not remaining stagnant by keeping up with industry trends</li>
				<li>Have a professionally respected and trusted voice</li>
				<li>Develop leadership skills</li>
				<li>Strive for balance, this includes both work-life balance, and a balance between work-related stress
					but been challenged and enjoying what I do</li>
				<li>Work for a large multinational company (for example Aurecon)</li>
				<li>Develop my soft skills, with a focus on communication, conflict resolution and teamwork</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The multidisciplinary skillset provided by mechatronics engineering is very appealing to me and provides
				for a wide range of job prospects. However, the counter side to this breadth is my specialised skills
				are
				not as well developed. Hence, having clearly articulated goals, and recognising areas for
				self-improvement is paramount. Utilising Tomlinson’s (2017) capitals to analyse areas within each
				capital I excel at and aspects that have significant room for growth is detailed below.
			</p>

			<strong>Human</strong>
			<p>I have developed a range of technical skills by maintaining a strong
				work ethic. My focus is on understanding the content rather than rote/memorisation-based learning
				approaches, which puts me in good stead for the transition to the labour market. I have developed
				discipline specific knowledge, and a strong problem-solving mindset through <i>over a thousand hours</i>
				of
				experience in various internships. I am a slow learner, however once the understanding is developed, I
				can conceptualise the topic in a much broader view. This slower approach makes time management and
				self-discipline paramount and is an area for improvement to ensure the short-term goals are completed by
				their respective deadlines. </p>

			<strong>Social</strong>
			<p>I have started to develop a network of contacts through several internships. In addition, I have
				developed strong customer side skills by working in a retail environment for several years, progressing
				up to a team leader role. I have cultivated this experience through further formal leadership training
				and through volunteer work managing several projects with MCAV. This has strongly developed my teamwork
				and communication skillsets, which will be advantageous in any career direction. The main area for
				improvement is the ability to recognise opportunities as they arise, and leveraging ‘weak-ties’, which
				is important when job-hunting and when completing my engineering final year project (FYP). </p>

			<strong>Cultural</strong>
			<p>I have developed a diverse range of friends and colleagues and have demonstrated a rich awareness in a
				variety of volunteer roles, both locally, for example on the tennis club committee, and internationally.
				This exposure has fostered both my appreciation and understanding of various cultures to be able to
				present myself in a dynamic manner. Going forward, to continue to grow I should maintain an open mindset
				and be eager to further my understanding and my adaptability.</p>

			<strong>Identity</strong>
			<p>Through a firm set of values, being kind and adopting a consistent mindset I have continued to develop
				the skillsets that form my identity capital. By taking ownership and being introspective, I have
				developed a more accurate reflection of my strengths and the areas for improvement. Going forward I will
				continue to invest sufficient time in myself and develop action plans, maintaining a logical, rational
				mindset. </p>

			<strong>Psychological</strong>
			<p>I have developed career trajectories in the medical sector and in the energy sector, these contingency
				plans ensure my career can continue progressing. I have demonstrated a capability to perform under
				pressure working at the Australian Open, and a
				capability to think on my feet through volunteer work with Robogals. In addition, between the
				internships I have completed I have encountered several setbacks, I have been made redundant, and learnt
				from mistakes along the way. From these, in addition to adapting to working and studying remotely, I
				have learnt to be more proactive, to have clear goals and expectations, and to be more resilient.

				<h2>Part 2:
					What I’ve learned</h2>
			</header>
			<p>As per a survey of over 1500 CEOs, the critical factor governing a business’s future success is
				creativity (Landry, 2017). Creativity is “the tendency to generate, or recognise ideas, alternatives, or
				possibilities that may be useful in solving problems, communicating with others…” (California State
				University Northridge, n.d.). Creativity is foundational to businesses, and commerce as a subset of
				this, because it provides a point of <strong>differentiation</strong>. </p>

			<p>Creativity fosters innovation and teamwork and enhances productivity by challenging conventional notions
				and encouraging the development of thought-provoking, unique ideas. The benefit is a diverse range of
				proposed solutions as individuals and teams make connections between different ideas and solve new
				problems. This can enhance company culture, working in an environment that is conducive to creativity
				and improve the company’s retention rate. Individually, creativity develops resilience, that is
				psychological capital, which is highly valued in an unpredictable and changing commercial environment.
			</p>

			<div class="box">
				<p>“… [82% believed that] companies that are more creative gain greater business benefits like revenue
					growth and market share” (Forrester, 2014).</p>
			</div>

			<p>As part of BEX3500 I have demonstrated creativity in the form of video production, from scripting to
				graphic design to recording. In addition, the creation of two modern websites. Further to this, a
				creative mindset was demonstrated when coming up with novel ways Mastercard can help mitigate climate
				change factoring in a range of constraints. This mindset will be advantageous to me as a commerce
				graduate as I can utilise this skillset advantageously for companies. Important attributes directly
				associated with creativity are detailed below.</p>

			<p><strong>Curiosity</strong>, always asking “why?” is key to engineering:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>develop an active mind, rather than a passive one</li>
				<li>general eagerness and excitement</li>
				<li>observant of new ideas and premises</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Calculated risk-taking</strong>: innovation cannot occur without some element of risk, such as
				time and financial capital for engineering R&D:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Bring about unforeseen opportunities</li>
				<li>Convey confidence</li>
				<li>Continue to learn and move forward, not stagnant due to a fear of change</li>
			</ul>

			<p>To grow as a creative engineer I should be <strong>flexible/adaptable</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Enhanced value as an employee, people turn to you to motivate them and accommodate change</li>
				<li>Reduced stress, more resilient</li>
				<li>Enhanced productivity, demonstrate grit</li>
				<li>Better equipped to be an effective leader</li>
			</ul>

			</figure>

			<br>


			<p>Within the commercial realm, creativity is complemented by critical thinking. This is important
				considering increasing pressure for companies
				and individuals to be resourceful and act in an ethical, sustainable, and responsible manner. Given an
				increasing speed of business, greater information flow, and increasing globalisation the ability to
				analyse, synthesize and evaluate information to make timely and rational, rather than reactive,
				decisions is key. This reduces the likelihood and severity of mistakes, saving money. Critical thinking
				provides a “significant and measurable competitive advantage” (Chartrand, Ishikawa & Flander, 2013, p.
				8). It is important for organisational planning, and risk management/assessment to be able to pre-empt
				issues before they arise and consider a variety of perspectives to come to a measured
				conclusion. </p>

			<p>Effective critical thinking requires the use of several attributes. It requires a diligent, open-mind
				and the capability to detect inconsistencies in reasoning. Individuals with strong critical thinking
				skills can help reconcile tension, as they are able to remain impartial by having an awareness of their
				own biases and predispositions. Critical thinking facilitates the capability to act with autonomy in
				changing environments which will be an invaluable skill as
				a commerce graduate. </p>

			<p>BEX3500 has required the utilisation of critical thinking skills on several occasions. Firstly, when
				coming up with rational, feasible solutions for the major project, demonstrating the ability to consider
				the merits of each proposed action plan, and ascertain potential consequences. In addition, when
				planning the reflective interview questions to ensure the best use of the interviewees time. Moreover,
				when reflecting on our individual strengths and weaknesses in relation to Tomlinson’s (2017) model.
				Finally, the workshop exercises, such as analysing the impact to stakeholders, considering the big
				picture and potential steps going forward required critical thinking.</p>

			<p>Critical thinking is important to be able to navigate complex ethical issues, or uncertainty, such as in
				risky or complex situations, which is pertinent in the field of mechatronics, and increasing automation
				and usage of artificial intelligence. Reflecting on the interview it is apparent even in large
				multinational companies, a lack of appropriate resources can be an issue, and thus critical thinking is
				required to generate appropriate solutions. An additional observation was that communication skills are
				essential, and these skills are strengthened by critical thinking and the capability to identify they
				key elements of a problem. Going forward I will maintain a deliberately curios and inquisitive nature to
				foster the growth of my critical thinking skills, as per Calma and Davis (2020) “Critical thinking is a
				leading skill for workplace, educational and life success.”</p>

			<p>In relation to the resources required to achieve the above objectives, most require a laptop, an internet
				connection, and a diligent, disciplined mindset. Additional costly hardware, such as oscilloscopes, that
				may be required to achieve goals 3 and 6 should be accessible once appropriate vaccination targets are
				reached and Monash Makerspace re-opens. </p>

			<p>Some potential setbacks include the steep learning curve associated with goals 2, 3, 5 and 6. To remedy
				these I will adopt a step-by-step approach, starting with smaller simpler projects, and gradually
				progressing in complexity. Finding appropriate projects may also be difficult. Goal 1 will face time
				management constraints which can be addressed through organisation and planning. Whilst I am fortunate
				enough to <i>have a graduate role already lined up if desired</i>, I will continue to monitor Seek,
				LinkedIn
				etc. for potential graduate jobs to tailor the short- and long-term goals to, to keep doors open. </p>

			</div>

			<p>The resources, potential impedances, and strategies to mitigate these includes:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Contacts in a wide variety of companies to obtain a clear picture of the trends within industry. To
					address this, I will attend networking nights and utilise my growing social capital to develop and
					foster relationships</li>
				<li>An environment to develop and demonstrate the technical and soft skills to cultivate a
					professionally respected opinion. The challenge is finding an organisational culture that I gel
					with. To remedy I will conduct adequate research of the company, and reach out to employees where
					practical to gauge if an appropriate fit</li>
				<li>Leadership skills, ensure to take up any opportunities to develop and demonstrate. The challenge
					will be some engineering leadership roles may involve a migration to a sales or project management
					role, which is not of interest at present </li>
				<li>Critical thinking and perception to recognise when there are no further opportunities in a given
					role
				</li>
				<li>Cost will be an issue if pursuing a master’s degree. To remedy this, seek employment at a larger
					corporation where the master’s degree may be subsidized</li>
			</ul>

			<p>To achieve these long-term goals, I will focus on my identity capital, to gain a more accurate reflection
				of myself and my strengths and weaknesses. This will help me recognise how I can more effectively work
				in a team environment. Teamwork also requires strong communication skills, which in turn requires a
				strong technical foundation and critical thinking. It requires a demonstration of accountability, based
				on relationships formed from utilising social and cultural capital. Improved psychological capital will also be important, as per
				a professional engineering survey, 77.8% of respondents reported a stressful work environment (Flaig,
				2020). Thus, continuing to develop resilience, the capability to be adaptable, and manage stress, will
				be critical to a long, healthy career as an engineer. </p>
